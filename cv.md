# Cover Letter

Below are the 5 reasons why hiring me, the ex-teacher, is the right choice. (I decided to use the word “teachers” instead of “me” and “I” to avoid bragging)

1) **Communication skills:** It goes without saying teachers have incredible communication skills and this is a huge advantage. Companies are looking for developers that aren't just sitting there, poking code. They want people to be able to speak articulately about what they're doing, talk to leadership, communicate their ideas and thoughts. This is just obviously a huge advantage that teachers pull over into their software development career.

2) **Interpersonal skills** kind of goes hand in hand with communication but being able to work on a team really productively, initiate brainstorming, maybe pull the people that don't have the best interpersonal skills, maybe more introverted, pull them up, be able to like lift them up, make them better. I think this is just incredibly valuable to any team and teachers are famous for having these great interpersonal skills. 

3) **Empathy:** Teachers are naturally extremely empathetic people and this is really helpful in software development because they are able to think of the user, build code for everyone, really think about who's going to be using the software, anticipating their needs and desires and then really creating an incredible experience for the users. This is also extremely helpful for navigating unique team dynamics, be able to work with people that come from really different backgrounds. 

4) **Selflessness:** Teachers are some of the most selfless people. They really want to make a difference in the world. They want to make a bigger impact. They care about others. This is just a great quality to have and bringing it into software development will just really make teachers stand out. Teachers can help a team thrive because they have a unique ability to bring people together and help build them up so not only are they going to be an amazing software developer themselves but help other people to be great in their jobs also.

5) **Teaching:** teachers are good teachers. Also, it definitely goes without saying, teachers learn so many new skills and everyone around them is constantly trying to upskill, want to learn more and having a teacher on a team and being able to articulate these ideas to teammates, to other teams also because a software developer doesn't just work with other developers, he works with UX guys, he work with marketing, he works with leadership. Being able to teach everyone else about what he's doing and why is so valuable.
